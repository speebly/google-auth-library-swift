# Sample credentials

This directory contains sample application credentials for various services.

To use a service, sign up with the service provider, register an app, and
put your app's consumer key and consumer secret (OAuth1) or client id and
client secret (OAuth2) in the corresponding JSON file. 

Then move that JSON file into a directory named `.credentials` in your home
directory.
